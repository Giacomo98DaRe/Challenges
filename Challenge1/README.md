# Challenge 1 - Plant Classification



Classification problem on a plant dataset.



Image classification project on a plant dataset. The goal is to train a CNN that predicts the plant class from an input image.



## TL;DR

- \*\*Task:\*\* multi-class image classification (plants).

- \*\*Input:\*\* RGB images organized in subfolders (one folder per class).

- \*\*Output:\*\* class label.

- \*\*Metric:\*\* top-1 accuracy (optionally per-class F1/recall).
